# MedicalDB-PDFBOT
Using langchain, create a bot with a user interface that will enable the user to search medical topics and receive information from reputable medical databases with PDF. Utilize agents, tools and chains to access relevant API's for databases from google search, wikipedia, and PubMed. Then allow the user to query the PDF as they so require. 

This project aims to simplify the intesive process of scouring medical academic resources for particular facts, quantitative measurements and related data.
